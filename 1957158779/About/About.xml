	<description>Vanilla Furniture Expanded - Farming module is a great way to boost the efficiency of your colonies when it comes to providing food on the table. With a plethora of new hydroponics - one for early game and one for late game, you can really witness the technological progression of your colony - and gain more enjoyment from the game itself.

A very popular request on all suggestion threads on RimWorld Ludeon forums is draggable hydroponics - at this point I believe itâ€™s my duty to deliver, hence all three kinds of hydroponics now have a draggable version! Make it any shape you want!

New structures by the likes of animal feeder, a sprinkler and a scarecrow have been added, each with unique code to make them feel more authentic. The scarecrow will actually make animals flee, hence stopping them from devouring all your precious potatoes!

	<description>What I think this game was missing from the usual combat encounters is a punch, a smell of freshly fired bolters, the heat of an autocannon barrel and the look of surprise on the enemy faces as 10 homing missiles decimate their ranks. Vanilla Weapons Expanded - Heavy is our response to that task: This mod adds incredibly heavy weapons that can only be equipped on a handful of pawns - be it power armored troopers, pawns with a Tough trait or soldiers wearing our new industrial tech exosuits.

These weapons utilise the limited-use code, just like vanilla triple rocket launcher, except they can be fired more than once. After the weapon depletes, it breaks, which means you need to simply craft a new one. No ammo system, nothing like that!

Vanilla Weapons Expanded is part of a series of mods expanding on everyday life on the Rimworld. When paired together with a brand new Vanilla Apparel Expanded and Vanilla Armours Expanded, you can bring something to your game that will keep you interested in it for days.

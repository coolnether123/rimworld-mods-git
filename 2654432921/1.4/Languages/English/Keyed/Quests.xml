	<RotR_Quest_KidneyTrade_Title>Kidney Trade</RotR_Quest_KidneyTrade_Title>
	<RotR_Quest_KTIntro>(A weary but determined trader. {trader_possessive} eyes, shadowed beneath a weathered brow, flicker with a mix of hope and desperation.)\n\nPlease, I need your help. I've come to offer something valuable in exchange for your assistance.\n\nMy family and our settlement are in dire straits, and we desperately need the funds.\n\nHow would you like to buy a perfectly good kidney for a cheaper price? Only slightly used, I assure you.\n\n({trader_pronoun} presents it with an air of nonchalance.)</RotR_Quest_KTIntro>
	<RotR_Quest_KTIntro_Trade>We could use the extra organ. Let's make a deal.</RotR_Quest_KTIntro_Trade>
	<RotR_Quest_KTIntro_Question>How do you happen to have an... extra kidney?</RotR_Quest_KTIntro_Question>
	<RotR_Quest_KTIntro_Refuse>We're not in the market for organs right now, but thanks for the offer.</RotR_Quest_KTIntro_Refuse>
	<RotR_Quest_KTExplain>Don't worry, the kidney I'm selling isn't mine. It's a... friend's. Yes, a very generous friend.</RotR_Quest_KTExplain>
	<RotR_Quest_KTExplain_Trade>A kidney is a kidney, I suppose. Let's do the trade.</RotR_Quest_KTExplain_Trade>
	<RotR_Quest_KTExplain_QuestionSituation>Tell me more about your situation. Why do you need the funds?</RotR_Quest_KTExplain_QuestionSituation>
	<RotR_Quest_KTExplain_Refuse>That sounds... highly unethical. I think we'll pass.</RotR_Quest_KTExplain_Refuse>
	<RotR_Quest_KTExplainSituation>It's the raiders. They've been relentless, and we've exhausted all our resources just trying to keep them at bay.\n\nWe need to buy protection, repair our defenses... anything to keep my family safe. I'm out of options.</RotR_Quest_KTExplainSituation>
	<RotR_Quest_KTExplainSituation_Trade>Alright, we'll do this. But only because it seems you're out of options.</RotR_Quest_KTExplainSituation_Trade>
	<RotR_Quest_KTExplainSituation_Refuse>It's better if you keep your kidney. Relying on such extreme measures\nwon't solve your problems in the long run.</RotR_Quest_KTExplainSituation_Refuse>
	<RotR_Quest_KTRefused_LastTry>Please, I understand your reservations, but this isn't just about a trade for me—it's about survival.\n\nMy settlement... we're on the brink. Without this trade, I don't know if we'll make it.</RotR_Quest_KTRefused_LastTry>
	<RotR_Quest_KTRefused_LastTry_Trade>Your situation has touched us, and we've reconsidered. We'll accept the trade</RotR_Quest_KTRefused_LastTry_Trade>
	<RotR_Quest_KTRefused_LastTry_Refuse>I'm sorry, but our decision is final.</RotR_Quest_KTRefused_LastTry_Refuse>
	<RotR_Quest_KTTradeOutcome>The trader's tension eased as you finalize the trade, {trader_possessive} shoulders dropping in a sigh of relief. {trader_nameDef} managed a brief, grateful smile towards your colonists before turning to leave, {trader_possessive} steps lighter than when {trader_pronoun} arrived.</RotR_Quest_KTTradeOutcome>
	<RotR_Quest_KTRefuseOutcome>A flash of disappointment crosses {trader_nameDef}'s face, quickly masked as {trader_pronoun} nodded in acknowledgment of your decision.\n\nWithout a backward glance, {trader_pronoun} gathered {trader_possessive} belongings and stepped away, {trader_possessive} movements deliberate and slow.</RotR_Quest_KTRefuseOutcome>

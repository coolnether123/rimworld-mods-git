				<tooltip>Normally, animals are broken into "categories" based on gameplay usefulness and common sense, which determine which kinds of prosthetics can and can't be installed into them. Specifically:
				
Category 1 - medieval prostheses
Rodents and other tiny animals for which I think installing even simple prosthetics would be silly.

Category 2 - simple prostheses
Livestock and other animals which can't be trained or can't carry extra mass in caravans (except for the house cat).

Category 3 - bionic prostheses
Pack animals and trainable pets (and the house cat).

Disabling this will allow all animal surgeries to be performed on all animals.

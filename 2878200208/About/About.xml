    Updated to 1.4 by Rain. Removed fine carpet, updated other carpets to the new carpet system. Due to the new carpet system, they are hard coded to be in Floors and not More Floors. All floors taht could be convertaed to paintable are now paintable. Added pollution overlay for biotech users.

    Adds a wide selection of new flooring to decorate your colony with.

● Six new styles of wooden flooring (plus straw floors for that barn feel)
● Eleven new styles of stone flooring in all five stone colours (for a total of 55 variations)
● Eight styles of chequered stone floor in various combinations
● Six new cloth carpet colours - orange, yellow, turquoise, purple, black, and white
● New checkered carpet style in all colours
● New wool carpet style in all colours using wool cloth, woven at the added loom workbench
● Two end-game floors for larger colonies built with plasteel and jade

Note: The new types of stone flooring only become available to build once the Stonecutting research project has been completed.
